Discussion with Dixit and Nalebuff

CONTEXT

The thing we are discussing: the Cornhuskers versus the Hurricans game.

MY CONTENTION

(-a-) Consider the Proposition P that the Coach should have gone for a tie (P = "the Coach should have gone for a tie"). Call it a Proposition or call it an argument - it comes to the same thing.
(-b-) This Proposition P can be supported with statistical evidence.
(-c) The argument Nalebuff and Dixit are making (call it Q) can also be supported with statistical evidence. 
(-d-) Now, whether P is the right answer to the Case or Q is the "right answer" to the Case is an entirely subjective assessment.

NEXT THING TO DO

(-) Post more stuff to the GitHub repo.
